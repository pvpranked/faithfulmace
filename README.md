This is the source code for the Faithful Mace mod! 

This is a fully combat accurate backport of the mace, its enchants, and the wind charge, and is used for the [PVP Ranked](https://modrinth.com/mod/pvpranked) mod.

The mod is available at https://modrinth.com/mod/faithful-mace!

Please report bugs either in the issue tracker in this github (which I will see but do not check often), or by pinging me in the PVP Ranked discord at https://discord.com/invite/gvXYZvBcke!

This mod is available under the MIT license! Check out the LICENSE file to see what that means.
